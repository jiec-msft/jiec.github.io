[HTTP/2 is a major revision of the HTTP network protocol used by the World Wide Web](https://edgeservices.bing.com/edgesvc/chat?udsframed=1&form=SHORUN&clientscopes=chat,noheader,udsedgeshop,channelstable,&shellsig=24c96090a1eee5763f89ef9229d2c8685849c80e&setlang=en-US&darkschemeovr=1#) [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2). [It was developed by the HTTP Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and is the first new version of HTTP since HTTP/1.1, which was standardized in RFC 2068 in 1997](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2) [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2). [HTTP/2 was derived from the earlier experimental SPDY protocol, originally developed by Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2) [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2). [The protocol was designed to address the performance limitations of HTTP/1.1 and to improve page load speed in web browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2) [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2).

[HTTP/2 is an international standard that was published as RFC 7540 on May 14, 2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2) [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2). [It maintains high-level compatibility with HTTP/1.1, such as methods, status codes, header fields, and URIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2) [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2). [However, it introduces new features for increased speed, such as data compression of HTTP headers, HTTP/2 Server Push, prioritization of requests, and multiplexing multiple requests over a single TCP connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2) [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2)[2](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/two).

[HTTP/2 is supported by most major browsers including Chrome, Opera, Firefox, Internet Explorer 11, Safari, Amazon Silk, and Edge browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2) [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2). [As of July 2023, about 36% of the top 10 million websites support HTTP/2](https://edgeservices.bing.com/edgesvc/chat?udsframed=1&form=SHORUN&clientscopes=chat,noheader,udsedgeshop,channelstable,&shellsig=24c96090a1eee5763f89ef9229d2c8685849c80e&setlang=en-US&darkschemeovr=1#) [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2)[3](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/). [Its successor is HTTP/3, which builds on the concepts established by HTTP/2 and uses QUIC + UDP instead of TCP/IP connections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2) [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2)[4](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-html-definition-and-meaning/).
