Java EE stands for Java Platform, Enterprise Edition. It is a collection of technologies and APIs for the Java platform designed to support “Enterprise” Applications which can generally be classed as large-scale, distributed, transactional and highly-available applications designed to support mission-critical business requirements.

Java EE is developed using the Java Community Process, with contributions from industry experts, commercial and open source organizations, Java User Groups, and countless individuals 1. It is the standard in community-driven enterprise software.

Java EE offers a rich enterprise software platform with over 20 compliant Java EE implementations to choose from 1. The latest version of Java EE is Java EE 8, which continues to improve API and programming models needed for today’s applications and adds features requested by the worldwide community. Enhancements include:

- Java Servlet 4.0 API with HTTP/2 support
- Enhanced JSON support including a new JSON binding API
- A new REST Reactive Client API
- Asynchronous CDI Events
- A new portable Security API
- Server-Sent Events support (Client & Server-side)
- Support for Java SE 8 new capabilities (e.g. Date & Time API, Streams API, annotations enhancements)

You can learn more about the technologies that comprise the Java EE 8 platform using the specifications, and then apply them with the Java EE 8 SDK.


## What's the difference between Java SE and Java EE?
**Java SE** stands for **Java Platform, Standard Edition**. [It is a platform for developing and deploying portable code for desktop and server environments](https://www.baeldung.com/java-se-ee-me) [1](https://www.baeldung.com/java-se-ee-me). [Java SE provides the core functionalities of the Java language, including the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Java Runtime Environment (JRE), and Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.baeldung.com/java-se-ee-me) [1](https://www.baeldung.com/java-se-ee-me)[2](https://www.javaguides.net/2023/08/java-se-vs-java-ee.html).

On the other hand, **Java EE** stands for **Java Platform, Enterprise Edition**. [It is a collection of technologies and APIs for the Java platform designed to support “Enterprise” Applications which can generally be classed as large-scale, distributed, transactional and highly-available applications designed to support mission-critical business requirements](https://www.baeldung.com/java-se-ee-me) [1](https://www.baeldung.com/java-se-ee-me)[2](https://www.javaguides.net/2023/08/java-se-vs-java-ee.html). Java EE is based on the Standard Edition and provides even more APIs. The new Java EE APIs allow us to create larger, scalable applications. Generally, Java EE applications are deployed to an application server. Many web-related APIs are provided to facilitate this: WebSocket, JavaServer Pages, JAX-RS, etc. The enterprise features also include APIs related to JSON processing, security, Java Message Service, JavaMail, etc. In a Java EE application, we can use everything from the standard APIs. [On top of that, we can use more advanced technologies](https://www.baeldung.com/java-se-ee-me) [1](https://www.baeldung.com/java-se-ee-me).

[In summary, while **Java SE** provides the fundamental building blocks for Java development, **Java EE** adds a comprehensive set of tools and APIs tailored for developing large-scale, complex enterprise applications](https://www.javaguides.net/2023/08/java-se-vs-java-ee.html) [2](https://www.javaguides.net/2023/08/java-se-vs-java-ee.html). The choice between the two will typically depend on the requirements and scale of the application you are developing.
